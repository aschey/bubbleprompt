# Tutorial

Let's build a simple app to demonstratate how to use Bubbleprompt.
The app will display a list of fruits and tell the user which one they selected.
The final code can be seen in the [basic example](https://github.com/aschey/bubbleprompt/tree/main/examples/basic/main.go).

## Starting Out

First, we need to choose an input.
We'll use the simple input here because we don't need any fancy features like custom parsing or flags.
By default, the simple input parses input text as a series of whitespace-delimited tokens.
It also supports using double quotes to define a single token, so `"two words"` will be parsed as one token rather than two.

<ExampleCode replace={{ main1: "main" }}>{TutorialStart}</ExampleCode>

The simple input component takes one generic parameter.
This parameter is used to define custom metadata that gets attached to each suggestion.
We don't need any custom metadata here so we'll leave it as `any`.

Next, we'll define a list of suggestions.
These will be shown underneath our input component.

<ExampleCode replace={{ main2: "main" }}>{TutorialSuggestions}</ExampleCode>

The `Suggestion` struct defines each list entry that we show.
Here we're using three properties: `Text`, `Description`, and `SuggestionText`.

- `Text` represents the text that the user should type to choose this suggestion.
  It gets rendered on the left side of the suggestion.
- `Description` is an optional second property we can pass in to add some additional context to the suggestion.
  It gets rendered on the right side.
- `SuggestionText` is a special property that we can pass in to override the text that gets shown in the suggestion lists.

Here we're using the `SuggestionText` property for the second entry because it has two words, so we need to wrap it in quotes to treat it as a single token.
However, we don't want to show the quotes in the suggestion list because that would look odd.

Now, let's create a model. This will implement the `InputHandler` interface and hold our program state.
Additionally, we store a style struct from [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) that we can use to add formatting to our output.

<ExampleCode>{TutorialModel}</ExampleCode>

Now we can create our model in our `main` function:

<ExampleCode replace={{ main3: "main" }}>{TutorialModelInit}</ExampleCode>

## The Complete Method

In order to render our suggestions onto the screen, we need to define the `Complete` method.

<ExampleCode>{TutorialComplete}</ExampleCode>

This method is responsible for returning a list of suggestions based on the user input.
Typically you'll have a predefined list of suggestions and you'll want to apply some kind of filtering function to replace the suggestions that aren't relevant to what the user typed.
Bubbleprompt provides a few predefined filtering functions in the `completer` package for convenience, but you're free to generate the list of suggestions however you want.

We use `simpleinput`'s `CurrentTokenBeforeCursor` method to get the text that the user typed before the cursor.
Since the list of suggestions always stays in sync with the cursor as it moves left or right,
it's expected that the completer function should only take into account what's before the cursor, rather than always checking the entire input.

## The Update Method

The `Update` method is part of the standard Bubbletea event loop.
It gets invoked whenever the program receives some kind of event.
See the [Bubbletea docs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/tutorials/basics#the-update-method) for more information.

<ExampleCode>{TutorialUpdate}</ExampleCode>

Here we record every time the user presses enter so we can show this information later.

## The Execute Method

The executor method is invoked whenever the user presses enter.
It checks the user's input and returns a [tea.Model](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/tutorials/basics#the-model) that gets rendered to the output.
The returned model will take over the event loop until it finishes, and then we can start the process over.

<ExampleCode>{TutorialExecute}</ExampleCode>

Here we check if the user entered in any input and display their choice if they did.
The executor method requires that we return a `tea.Model`, but it would be rather annoying to have to
manually create a new model for simple cases like showing a line of text.
For these cases, the `executor` package supplies several prebuilt models for common situations.

## Putting It All Together

Now that we have all the building blocks, we can finish writing our `main` function.

<ExampleCode replace={{ main4: "main" }}>{TutorialMain}</ExampleCode>

With that in place, everything should be functional.
This is what the whole program looks like:

## Complete Program

<ExampleCode replace={{ model2: "model" }}>{TutorialFinal}</ExampleCode>
