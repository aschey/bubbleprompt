## Tokenization

<div>
  Bubbleprompt's input handling uses the concept of <b>tokenization</b> to parse
  user input. This makes it easier to perform operations on specific parts of
  the user input. The most common tokenization method is to split input on
  whitespace. For example, if the input is <Code>"this is some text"</Code>, the
  tokenized input would be{" "}
  <Code>["this", " ", "is", " ", "some", " ", "text"]</Code>.
</div>
